# SP_Notes_PY
This repo will be a collection of notes and revision- Python centered
This will be broken up into the following structure:

<b> Python Notes </b>
  
 - GeneralPythonNotes
   - Quick Python reminder
   - Going through arrays, list, dict, tuples (tuple unpacking)
   - Slices,Split, Upper, Lower, comparison operators
   - IF's, Loops, Functions, Map, Lambda,Checking contents of a list

-  NumPy-Arrays
    - Run through of NumPy, creating arrays (1-D and 2-D)
   - arange, zeros, linspace, identity matrix (eye), random, randn, randint
   - reshape, min, max, argmax, argmin, shape, reshape, dtype

- NumPy-Indexing
  - Focuses on indexing and Selection
  - Runs through creating arrays with NP and using slice
  - Broadcasting NumPy arrays (and the differencing between doing this on a slice and a copy)
  - Indexing a 2-d array (single and doube bracket format, getting chunks,boolean array

<b> Machine Learning Related </b>
- KNNTest
    -   Followed tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQveSaMyEwM for KNN using SciKit-Learn
    -   Importing data into an array, looking at feature and target names, using (Pandas, MatPlotLib, NumPy)
    -   Splitting test and training data, running knn.fit() and picking a k-number
    -   Evaluating classifier accuracy, plotting confusion_matrix (and making it look good with matplotlib and seaborn) and classification_report

- KNN_Exercise1_Digits
   - Exercise i attempted from a brief using the digits dataset using SciKit-Learn for KNN
   - Completed and written up step-by-step
